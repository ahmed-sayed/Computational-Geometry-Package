#Computational Geometry Library#

This is a Computational Geometry Library implemented mainly to be used in educational purposes.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Implementing a well-designed, documented Computational Geometry(CG) library to be used in educational purposes that enables students to spend their time designing a good CG algorithms rather than designing the library itself and helps the TA's also in testing the students' purposed solutions efficiently.


### Currently Working In ###

* Set the basic structure and design of the library 

### To-Do feature list ###
